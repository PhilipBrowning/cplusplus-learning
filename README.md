### Learning c++

This repo is used for me to learn c++ through small programs

A lot of the examples are from C++ FULL COURSE For Beginners (Learn C++ in 10 hours)

Compiling this on a mac using g++ on brew I had to add the c++ version for any c++11 features

Example
```c++
g++ -std=c++11 class-example.cpp -o ../build/class-example
```
